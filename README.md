# PyModules
I recently started this Python wrapper for some C++ functions and classes in Mathutils and Pertutils.
This is a new python module which should expose some of the functions in pertutils and in my other, currently private repo containing optimized implementations of mathematical functions to python. I am currently building it up,
so it is far from being completed.
